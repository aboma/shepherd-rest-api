== Vilio Digital Asset Management API

Vilio is a Document Asset Management (DAM) server API for storing and serving media files with metadata.  For a application client, please visit the associated vilio-emberjs-client repository.

== Why Vilio?

Unlike other Digital Asset Management applications:
+ Vilio enables you to put the same file in multiple portfolios (containers), so that you may have one canonical version of a file.
+ Vilio enables your users to generate and configure metadata templates from the UI, without any coding.
+ Vilio separates the server from the client using Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), to allow you to build your own user interface in the technology of your choice.
