# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
# user = V1::User.new(:email => 'admin@shepherd.com', :password => '', :first_name => 'Shepherd', 
#                          :last_name => 'Admin')
# user[:updated_by_id] = 1
# user[:created_by_id] = 1
# user.save
# puts "Created seed users" if user.valid?
# puts user.errors.full_messages.to_sentence unless user.valid?
