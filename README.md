# Shepherd RESTful Digital Asset Management API

Shepherd is a Document Asset Management (DAM) server API for storing and serving media files with metadata.  For a application client, please visit the associated shepherd-emberjs-client github repository.

## Why ShepherdDAM?

Unlike other Digital Asset Management applications:

+ Shepherd enables you to put the same file in multiple portfolios (containers), so that you may have one canonical version of a file but show the same view of it in multiple places.
+ Shepherd enables your users to generate and configure metadata fields and templates from the UI without any coding.
+ Shepherd separates the server from the client using Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), to allow you to build your own client application or user interface in the technology of your choice.
